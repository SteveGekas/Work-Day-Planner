Work-Day-Planner

## Description 

I used the HTML and CSS files to construct a script.js file to make a daily planner.

## Installation

I opened index.html in Google Chrome to test the code the was written and updated in the HTML, CSS and JS files.


## Usage 

You can add events in each text area for each hour of the work day.  When you click the save button, the information will be stored in loca storage.  When you refresh the page, the information will be recalled from local storage.  If you were to refresh the page a second time, the information will be cleared.
