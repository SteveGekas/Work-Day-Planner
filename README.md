  ## Description
  I used the HTML and CSS files to construct a script.js file to make a daily planner.

  ## Installation
  OPen the HTML file in a browser to fill in the planner.

  ## Usage
  You can add events in each text area for each hour of the work day.  When you click the save button, the information will be stored in loca storage.  When you refresh the page, the information will be recalled from local storage.  If you were to refresh the page a second time, the information will be cleared.

  ## Contributions
